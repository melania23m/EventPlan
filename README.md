# EventPlan

I created this website-type application that has the functionality of adding, modifying, deleting your own events. The user is helped to create an event step by step, to be able to calculate a budget, to tick certain actions during the organization of the event and to be able to choose certain suppliers to collaborate with.

*TECHNOLOGIES USED*
- Python
- Sqlite
- Django
- Bootstrap


The basic mode through which the user interacts with the database is represented by the Django MTV Pattern ( MODEL , VIEW , TEMPLATE )



The WEB application offers CRUD functionalities for creating, viewing, deleting, modifying events or reviews for the client side, and for the admin offers the possibility to manage the existence of suppliers.


The goal of the project was to implement a website through a USER can create a sketch for an event.

The website is still in its infancy, in the future I would like to implement the interface so that it is as interactive as possible, I would like suppliers to be able to log in to the application and create a connection between the client and the supplier.
